# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis - Module 19 - Challenge

### Overview and Purpose

Explain the purpose of the analysis

### Results

Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
	What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

	What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

	What variable(s) are neither targets or features, and should be removed for the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

	What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

### Summary

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
